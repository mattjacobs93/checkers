# checkers

## Play checkers locally against a friend or an AI oppoenent.
### Description: I chose checkers because I am a fan of the game and thought that it would provide a great opportunity to further develop my software engineering skills by building both the game/game logic as well as AI players. Start the game by choosing from one of four possible players (human, AI-Easy, AI-Medium, and AI-hard) for each player (red and black), then press "start" to start the game.
